[Research Agent Version - Quality: 0.88]
Multi-agent systems involve multiple autonomous agents interacting within 
a shared environment. Coordination mechanisms include centralized control, 
distributed decision-making, and negotiation-based approaches.

[Writing Agent Version - Quality: 0.85]
Imagine a team of AI agents working together, each with unique skills. 
Multi-agent systems coordinate these agents to solve complex problems 
no single agent could handle alone.

[Technical Agent Version - Quality: 0.92] ← SELECTED (Highest Quality)
Multi-agent systems (MAS) comprise autonomous agents operating in shared 
environments with partial observability. Coordination challenges include 
credit assignment, communication overhead, and emergent behavior analysis. 
Primary frameworks include CTDE (centralized training, decentralized execution), 
fully decentralized learning, and hybrid approaches.

[Editor Agent Version - Quality: 0.90]
Multi-agent systems coordinate multiple AI agents to tackle complex challenges. 
Key considerations include how agents communicate, divide responsibilities, 
and achieve collective goals despite individual perspectives and capabilities.
