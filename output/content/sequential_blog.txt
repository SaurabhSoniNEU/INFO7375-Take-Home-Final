[Step 1: Research Agent - Information Gathering]
Recent developments in artificial intelligence have accelerated dramatically. 
According to industry analysis, AI adoption has grown 270% over the past four 
years. Key trends include multimodal models, improved reasoning capabilities, 
and democratization of AI tools for everyday users.

[Step 2: Writing Agent - Narrative Enhancement]
The AI revolution isn't coming—it's already here, transforming how we work, 
create, and solve problems. What makes this moment particularly exciting is 
the convergence of powerful technology with intuitive interfaces. Anyone can 
now harness AI capabilities that were restricted to researchers just two years ago.

[Step 3: Editor Agent - Quality Refinement]
The AI revolution is already transforming how we work, create, and solve problems. 
What makes this moment particularly exciting is the convergence of powerful 
technology with intuitive, accessible interfaces. Capabilities once restricted 
to researchers are now available to everyone, democratizing innovation and 
accelerating progress across industries.
