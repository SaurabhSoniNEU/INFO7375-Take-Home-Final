[Supporting: Research Agent - Adds Background]
DQN, introduced by DeepMind in 2015 (Mnih et al.), revolutionized 
reinforcement learning by combining Q-learning with deep neural networks. 
The key innovations include experience replay for breaking temporal 
correlations and a separate target network for training stability.

[Supporting: Writing Agent - Enhances Clarity]
Understanding DQN requires grasping two core concepts: value function 
approximation and the exploration-exploitation dilemma. The Q-function 
Q(s,a) estimates expected future reward from state s taking action a.

[Supporting: Editor Agent - Final Polish]
DQN estimates Q(s,a)—the expected cumulative reward from state s when 
taking action a—using a neural network. This enables handling complex, 
high-dimensional state spaces impossible with tabular methods.
