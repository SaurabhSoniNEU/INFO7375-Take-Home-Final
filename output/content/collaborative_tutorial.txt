[Iteration 1, Agent 1: Research]
Reinforcement learning is a machine learning paradigm where agents learn 
by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties.

[Iteration 1, Agent 2: Writing]
Think of reinforcement learning like training a dog: good behavior gets 
treats (rewards), unwanted behavior doesn't. Over time, the dog learns 
which actions lead to treats.

[Iteration 1, Agent 3: Editor]
Reinforcement learning trains agents through trial and error, much like 
training a dog with treats. The agent tries different actions, receives 
feedback (rewards or penalties), and gradually learns optimal behavior.

[Iteration 2, Agent 1: Research]
Key components include: states (situations), actions (choices), rewards 
(feedback), and policy (learned strategy).

[Iteration 2, Agent 2: Writing]
Your RL journey starts with understanding four building blocks: the states 
your agent observes, the actions it can take, the rewards that guide learning, 
and the policy that emerges from experience.

[Iteration 2, Agent 3: Editor]
Your RL journey begins with four building blocks: states (what the agent 
observes), actions (available choices), rewards (feedback guiding learning), 
and the policy (learned decision strategy that emerges from experience).
