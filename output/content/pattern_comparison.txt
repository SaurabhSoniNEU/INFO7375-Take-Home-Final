COORDINATION PATTERN COMPARISON
================================

Task: "Write about AI Safety"
All patterns given same task, different coordination strategies:

-------------------------------------------------------------------
SEQUENTIAL PATTERN (Reward: 0.91)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Research → Writing → Editor

[Research] AI safety concerns include alignment problems, where AI 
systems pursue objectives misaligned with human values, and capability 
control challenges in advanced systems.

[Writing] Ensuring AI remains beneficial as it grows more powerful 
represents one of humanity's most pressing challenges. How do we build 
systems that reliably do what we want, even as they surpass human 
intelligence in narrow domains?

[Editor] As AI systems grow more powerful, ensuring they remain aligned 
with human values becomes critical. The challenge: building systems that 
reliably pursue intended objectives, even when operating beyond human 
supervision in complex domains.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
HIERARCHICAL PATTERN (Reward: 0.94)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Technical Agent leads, others contribute

[Lead: Technical] AI Safety Framework: Alignment, Control, Verification
[Research] Academic consensus identifies three key areas...
[Writing] Think of AI safety as programming with unprecedented stakes...
[Editor] Final polish integrating all perspectives coherently...

Result: Most comprehensive coverage, strong technical grounding.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
ADAPTIVE PATTERN (Reward: 0.95) ← HIGHEST
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thompson Sampling picks best agent each step

[Step 1: Technical Agent selected] Core safety challenges include...
[Step 2: Editor Agent selected] Refining for clarity and impact...
[Step 3: Writing Agent selected] Compelling call-to-action...

Result: Highest quality by dynamically selecting optimal agent for 
each content section.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

INSIGHT: Different patterns excel at different objectives
- Sequential: Consistent, predictable (0.91)
- Hierarchical: Comprehensive, well-structured (0.94)  
- Adaptive: Highest quality, flexible (0.95)

RL learns to pick the right pattern for each task automatically!
